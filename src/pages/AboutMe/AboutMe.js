                      <p className="card-text overflow-auto">I have been in the transplant industry since 2011. My career started at Indiana Donor Network (IDN) in 2011 as an Organ 
                        Procurement Coordinator. During my time at IDN, I managed all aspects of the organ procurement process. I also served on 
                        several committees and worked closely with the clinical manager to develop antibiotic and lung therapy protocols. In 2013 
                        I accepted a position with Buckeye Transplant Services (BTS) as an import coordinator where I closely work with transplant 
                        centers to evaluate organs and help facilitate the organ transplant process. As the company has grown, I have grown with it. 
                        I was promoted in 2015 to a Lead Coordinator, from there I was promoted to Clinical Support Manager. 
                        Buckeye Transplant is a unique company in healthcare and has given me a unique opportunity to learn many aspects of growing a 
                        company. After my time as a Clinical Support Manager, I transitioned into a HR Compliance Manager role where I helped Buckeye 
                        with the employee onboarding process and helped ensure compliance with all labor laws across all 50 states. While wearing many 
                        hats at Buckeye Transplant I became interested in how technology could help streamline and standardize our many processes. To 
                        help Buckeye Transplant grow, I transitioned into an IT Project Manager role to develop tools and applications to streamline 
                        and standardized our processes company wide. I am a highly motivated employee skilled in Customer Service, Interpersonal 
                        Skills, Management, Process Management, and Healthcare. </p>
